This tool generates some classes used by my entity component system (ECS) based minecraft server implementation.

So far the code is quite ugly/near unreadable and it generates:

* Block type and block state classes
* Item type/material classes
* Events wrapping [MCProtocolLib](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib) packets

Thanks to [MCProtocolLib](https://github.com/Steveice10/MCProtocolLib) for the protocol handling and inspiration.
